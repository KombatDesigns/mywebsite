      <h2>Wealth Management</h2>
      <p>Wealth management isn't just for the ultra-rich — it’s for everyone who earns a paycheck. For healthcare professionals, financial planning must account for factors like residency income, student debt, long working hours, and eventual burnout. Start with a budget, even a simple one, to track inflow and outflow. From there, contribute to tax-advantaged accounts like RRSPs and TFSAs. These accounts allow your investments to grow without immediate tax implications, and they form the base of long-term wealth.</p>
      <p>Begin with low-cost index funds. Don’t try to pick stocks unless you understand them well — broad diversification is your friend. Make it automatic with monthly transfers to investment accounts. As income increases, consider speaking to a fee-only financial planner. The earlier you build good habits, the less stressful the future becomes.</p>

      <h2>Insurance Planning</h2>
      <p>Insurance is not just about peace of mind — it’s about risk transfer. Disability insurance is especially critical for physicians and other high-income professionals. If you're unable to work due to illness or injury, disability insurance provides monthly income replacement. The younger and healthier you are when you apply, the cheaper and easier it is to qualify. Always read the policy fine print to understand the definition of "disability" and what’s excluded.</p>
      <p>Other essentials include critical illness insurance (lump sum payout for serious diagnoses), term life insurance (especially if you have dependents), and extended health benefits. Professional organizations often provide group plans with more favorable rates and fewer medical requirements.</p>

    <section id="legal" class="section">
      <h2>Pensions & Legal Considerations</h2>
      <p>If you work in a hospital or long-term care facility in Ontario, you're likely eligible for the Healthcare of Ontario Pension Plan (HOOPP). This is a defined benefit pension, which means your future retirement income is based on your salary and years of service — not the stock market. Contributions are deducted automatically from your paycheck and matched by your employer. The earlier you start, the more you benefit from compound growth and service credits.</p>
      <p>If you work privately or are incorporated, you'll need to take responsibility for your own retirement savings through RRSPs, IPPs (Individual Pension Plans), or a corporate investment strategy. Also consider legal safeguards such as a will, power of attorney, and — if incorporated — understanding the rules around retained earnings and tax-efficient withdrawals. Legal and tax advisors play a crucial role here.</p>

    <section id="billing" class="section">
      <h2>Billing in Ontario</h2>
      <p>OHIP billing is complicated — but manageable. Whether you're a GP or specialist, every encounter needs to be logged with the appropriate code. Submitting incorrect codes or missing deadlines could lead to clawbacks or audits. Thankfully, there are EMR systems and third-party tools that simplify this process. It’s critical to understand your most-used codes and fee modifiers. If you're unsure, start with a billing course or talk to your local medical association.</p>
      <p>Billing tips: Always document your work clearly. Submit claims frequently to avoid backlogs. Review remittance advice regularly to identify rejected claims or underpayments. You may also delegate billing to trained admin staff — but stay informed and review the numbers yourself.</p>
